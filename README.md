**Topic**:  
> No real world data collection process is perfect, and we are often left with all sorts of noise in our dataset: incorrectly recorded values, non-recorded values, corruption of data, etc. If we are able to spot all those irregular points, oftentimes the best we can do is treat them as missing values. Missing values are the fact of life if you work in data science, machine learning, or any other field that relies on the real-world data. Most of us hardly give those data points much thought, and when we do we rely on many ready-made tools, algorithms, or rules of thumb to deal with them. However, to do them proper justice you sometimes need to dig deeper, and make a judicious choice of what to do with them. And what you end up doing with them, like in many other circumstances in data science, can be boiled down to the trusted old phrase of “it depends”. Missing data can significantly impact the results of analyses and models, potentially leading to biased or misleading outcomes. -Bojan Tunguz
